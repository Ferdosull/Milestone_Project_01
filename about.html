                <p class="about-body opaque">RSEC stands for Red-Zone Space Exploration Company. 
                    RSEC is a private owned space exploration company which is part funded by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a> and the USA governments National Space League.  
                    RSEC is considered to be responsible for innovation in science and renewable electrical technology related to air and space flight. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-body opaque">RSEC was founded in 2012 and officially opened its doors for business in March of 2013. 
                    RSEC’s first paying clients were NASA. In 2013 NASA were in a position to part-share a percentage of their funding with other Aerospace bodies including RSEC. 
                    The task set out by NASA for RSEC was to design and build a space craft capable of housing 10 multidisciplined scientists while they 
                    continued to carry out experiments in Earths Outer Thermosphere and Exosphere in the hopes of some day colonising Mars.
                </p>
                <p class="about-body opaque">The space craft needed to provide an adequate living environment and be self sustainable for a period of 15 days before carrying out its descent back to Earth. 
                    Previous missions carried out by other private companies were successful but huge costs were involved in getting what should have been a relatively small spacecraft into the Exosphere. 
                    The fuel required for the return trip back from orbit needed to be present on the ascent also. This is what led other companies to increase the size of their spacecrafts to 2-3 times the required size. 
                    This additional weight and fuel added millions of dollars onto their budget which meant the experimentation missions were less frequent. 
                    Having the fuel onboard for the full 15 days before descent also posed its own issues and safety concerns. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-body opaque">The goal for RSEC was to reduce initial fuel & weight requirements and return back from orbit by a different more efficient method. 
                    In order to ensure RSEC were more efficient, Dr Warren Scruff (RSEC CEO) started interviewing and recruiting team members from all engineering professions and 
                    assembled a “Space Travel Efficiency R & D Team” which he headed up himself. The results of the team’s efforts culminated in the decision to place the first of 
                    its kind, Solar Re-Charge Docking Station “EVE-02” in the Earths Exosphere roughly 2000km above ground level. The docking station houses a 55MW Alu-Graphene-ion 
                    battery, capable of continues charging by utilising both solar energy (when in full view of the sun) and cosmic radiation adsorption (CAMS). 
                </p>
                <p class="about-body opaque">RSEC is known worldwide for its advancements in the battery sector and for its efficient conversion of radiation into safe usable power. 
                    The team’s discovery and evolution of the CAMS (Charged Atom Magnetic Separator) system was a game changer for the company which meant the return trip could be fuelled by 
                    recharging the crafts internal Alu-Graphene-ion battery, while docked at the EVE-02 station. The Alu-Graphene-ion battery was another victory for the company. Its charging capacity, 
                    power output and weight is unmatched by any other battery type on the market, the nearest being 16 times the same physical size for the equivalent power output.
                </p>
                <p class="about-body opaque">Fast-forward to 2018 and based on RSECs innovative and successful results, NASA made a decision to cement their unity with RSEC and together they have formed a Space Coalition. 
                    The declaration by both companies is to have the first human colony, “Layer 1”, set foot on Martian soil by the year 2029. NASA has agreed to provide the funding for these missions and have left RSEC to 
                    select the right candidates to research and develop equipment which will aid the first missions.
                </p>
                <p class="about-body opaque">It is now 2020 and Layer 1 works are well underway. As part of the ongoing evolution of RSECs tech, Warren has decided to hire more engineering staff to expand the <a href="weneedyou.html" target="_blank">RSEC Team</a> in the areas of: Advanced Medical Science, 
                    Information Technology, Agricultural Science and Engineering Science. Warren is looking for established professionals to join his team but also students who have the passion and drive, to place human life on Mars, that he shares. 
                    Students who apply will be evaluated for a scholarship based previous merits and project based team work. The successful candidates will be contacted by our HR Team.
